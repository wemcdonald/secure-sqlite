# Scaling Secure-SQLite Wrapper

This outlines a system design for scaling the SQLite wrapper for production use with an arbitrary SQL database.

## Problems to Address

### 1. Query Processing Overhead

Every query in the current system requires parsing and permission checking, with row-level security adding significant complexity to query execution. There's no caching of permission checks or query results, which creates performance bottlenecks under high load. The security checks themselves introduce overhead that needs to be optimized.

### 2. Connection Management

The current implementation creates new connections for each client without any pooling or reuse mechanism. This becomes problematic at scale as each connection requires its own resources and setup. We need an efficient connection pooling mechanism to handle high concurrency.

### 3. State Management

The included in-memory authProvider maintains all state in-memory within each connection, which creates challenges at scale. Each connection needs to independently validate permissions and maintain its own state, which becomes inefficient with many concurrent connections. We need a more efficient way to manage authentication and authorization state across connections.

### 4. Operational Needs

The current implementation lacks built-in audit logging or monitoring, making it difficult to understand performance and security issues at scale.

### 5. Auth Provider Implementation

The current in-memory auth provider is unsuitable for production use. We need a persistent, scalable auth provider implementation that can handle production workloads.

#### Table-Based Auth Strategy

A table-based implementation cound provide the persistence needed for production while maintaining query performance through aggressive caching and optimized data structures.

1. **Multi-Level Caching**

   - In-memory LRU cache for frequently accessed permissions
   - Redis/Memcached for distributed caching
   - Cache invalidation on permission changes
   - Configurable TTLs based on security requirements

2. **Efficient Permission Storage**

   - Denormalized permission tables for fast lookups
   - Bit-packed permission flags where applicable
   - Materialized views for complex permission queries
   - Partitioned tables for large permission sets

3. **Query Optimization**

   - Prepared statements for all permission queries
   - Indexed lookups on frequently queried fields
   - Batch permission checks for multiple tables
   - Permission pre-fetching for common access patterns

4. **Performance Considerations**

   - Cache hit ratio monitoring
   - Query performance tracking
   - Permission update batching
   - Background cache warming
   - Stale permission detection

5. **Security Features**
   - Permission change audit logging
   - Cache poisoning prevention
   - Rate limiting on permission checks
   - Permission validation at multiple levels

## Strategy

### 1. Query Processing Optimization

- **Query Plan Caching**: Cache parsed query plans and permission check results to avoid repeated parsing and validation
- **Prepared Statements**: Use prepared statements for frequently executed queries to reduce parsing overhead
- **Batch Operations**: Support batch operations to reduce the number of individual permission checks
- **Efficient Security Checks**: Optimize the permission checking algorithm to minimize overhead
- **Query Result Caching**: Cache query results with appropriate TTLs for read-heavy workloads

### 2. Connection Pooling

- **Fixed Pool Size**: Maintain a fixed pool of database connections based on system resources
- **Connection Reuse**: Reuse connections efficiently to minimize connection overhead
- **Health Checks**: Implement connection health checks to ensure pool reliability
- **Timeout Management**: Add configurable timeouts for idle connections
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate limits for maximum connections and pool size

### 3. State Management

- **Shared State**: Implement a thread-safe shared state manager for common data
- **Permission Cache**: Cache user permissions with appropriate invalidation strategies
- **Session Management**: Efficiently manage user sessions and authentication state
- **Memory Optimization**: Optimize memory usage for in-memory state
- **State Cleanup**: Implement proper cleanup of stale state

### 4. Operational Improvements

- **Structured Logging**: Add structured logging for all security-relevant operations
- **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance metrics (query times, cache hits, etc.)
- **Health Monitoring**: Implement health checks for critical components
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor and log resource usage patterns
- **Security Events**: Track and log security-related events for audit purposes
